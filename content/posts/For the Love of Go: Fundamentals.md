Learning Go isn't easy. There, we've said it. Some time and effort _will_ be required, but that's true of anything worth learning, and it doesn't mean we can't also have fun while we're doing it. 'For the Love of Go: Fundamentals' is a simple, practical, friendly, and entertaining book for complete beginners, with no programming experience necessary.

With the assistance of expert Go mentor and teacher [John Arundel](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/learn), you'll build a complete project in Go, step by step, using the popular test-driven development (TDD) process. Along the way, you'll learn a lot about the basics of programming, and even more about testing!

The best part of all is the price: just $4.99. You can read a full description of the book, along with some rave reviews, and buy it online here:
