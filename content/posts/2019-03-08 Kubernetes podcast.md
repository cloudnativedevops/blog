We were delighted to be featured recently on one of our favourite podcasts, Google's [Kubernetes Podcast](https://kubernetespodcast.com/):

> Kubernetes consultant and man with 100,000 Twitter followers, John Arundel, and DevOps engineer Justin Domingus, have just finished writing a new O'Reilly book called [Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes: Building, Deploying, and Scaling Modern Applications in the Cloud](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920175131.do). You can buy it at the regular places come March, but NGINX are [giving it away for free](https://www.nginx.com/resources/library/cloud-native-devops-with-kubernetes/) in ebook format, if you're willing to join their email list. As an aside, John *really* knows how to use Twitter. Even his book has over 5,000 followers already!

As an aside from *us*, we're very happy that so many of you are following us on Twitter! We've aimed to make the official 'Cloud Native DevOps' Twitter account a source for news, tips, and information about cloud and Kubernetes, as well as updates on the book itself. We're already having some really interesting conversations with our readers (and maybe future readers too). Hope to see you there!
