We recently interviewed software engineer [Torie Joy-Warren](/posts/kubernetes-at-work-torie-joy-warren/) about her experiences with Kubernetes and cloud. Here's the next post in our 'Kubernetes at Work' series: an interview with Seattle-based developer Katy Pedelty. Welcome, Katy!

<em>Katy moved to Seattle fresh out of school (go bears!) and has gleefully embraced drizzly weather and tiny 8-oz lattes. When not gazing into the eyes of her 11-year-old <s>muppet</s> bich-poo (look it up), Sophie, she can be found singing, napping, or stuffing her face with M&Ms.</em>

<strong>Hi, Katy! We really appreciate you dropping in to share your experiences with Kubernetes. What's your background in tech, and how did you get into development in the first place?</strong>

I didn’t ever think of computer science as something I might be into until I got to college. Luckily at that point another student inspired me to try Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (cred: SWE), and it turned out that I absolutely loved coding. So my first experience with software development was fall of freshman year! (I had written some HTML and CSS in 4th grade to make my Neopets shop look cooler.)

<strong>So, since this post is at least nominally about Kubernetes, and developers' real-life experiences with it behind the hype, let's turn to that. Real talk: are you now or have you ever been a Kuberneticist?</strong>

I have truly very little experience with Kubernetes. I heard the word ALWAYS at Google; the team was in our org (sometimes) and it seemed, to me, a more highly prioritized product than other bits of GCP.

Since then I have had occasion to try to understand containers in Docker as well as K8s, and I have learned to dread moments where I might need to do something with the tool.

I follow instructions from the Wiki by rote, and if there’s a problem I never know if I should finally dive in and learn the whole thing, or just get one-time help from a coworker. So far it’s always been the latter (often after a brief foray into docs), and when the same problem comes up in the future, it all happens again because none of it seems to stick in my brain.

I have a Kubernetes publication that I am actually reading now, at long last, and I am tentatively hopeful that next time I need to use a container or container engine or nodes or clusters or whatever the heck all those things are, I might have some better context for what I’m looking at.

<strong>We appreciate your candor. So, if this isn't a loaded question, which it is, what do you find most helpful about Kubernetes?</strong>

I mean, you can tell that I do not find K8s helpful.

After reading [Torie's interview](/posts/kubernetes-at-work-torie-joy-warren/), I’d like to add that learning Puppet felt much easier to me. But then there was indeed that hurdle of looking at a new repo which you’d otherwise never see. I would not have jumped that hurdle if I hadn’t been explicitly invited to.

<strong>Okay, so you might find it easier to answer the other side of that question: what do you find frustrating about Kubernetes?</strong>

I believe part of the problem is that it has terminology that doesn’t immediately suggest strong analogs in my brain, so when I learn anything, I feel like a sieve. I learn it momentarily, but there’s nowhere for my brain to file away the information for later, since there are so few connections that I can make to other deployment/hosting systems I’ve come in contact with (primarily VMs and bare metal).

I think it’s also likely that the terminology can’t have strong analogs, because the concept is different from any other services/tools I have used regularly in the past.

<strong>For real. Do you think Kubernetes has made your work as a developer easier or more complicated, then, overall?</strong>

Behind the scenes, maybe it’s easier. There’s some nice tooling in GCP that I benefit from, and it may be partially due to Kubernetes that we were able to have easier access to some of that tooling. But honestly, I am not really sure about that.

When *I* have to do anything with Kubernetes, I can’t say I find it easy.

<strong>How would you advise your younger self? For folks who are just getting started with cloud native tech, Go, and Kubernetes, how should they approach learning it?</strong>

I think for me the lesson is that some of this stuff is unlike what you may have seen before. If you are not great at memorizing things, like me, probably the best way to start is to put in time up front to get a foundation on which to build your understanding, rather than relying on creating connections to your previous experiences.

<strong>It was really great to talk with you, Katy. Thanks so much! Keep on crushing it, won't you?</strong>

Thank you for having me! I sure will.
