Kubernetes security is [in the news](https://threatpost.com/kubernetes-flaw-is-a-huge-deal-lays-open-cloud-deployments/139636/) at the moment, not necessarily in a good way. We thought it might be an appropriate time to share an interesting conversation we had recently with our friends Todd and Hannah at [Threat Stack](https://www.threatstack.com/) about Kubernetes, container security, and much more! We also had the fun of answering some questions from members of the audience.

Apart from hearing what we sound like, and in Justin's case, look like, you'll also hear a bit about how we came to write the 'Cloud Native DevOps' book, and exactly where we think security fits in to cloud native (spoiler: everywhere!)

Many thanks to DevOps.com for hosting the webcast, and to the magnificent Charlene O'Hanlon for being our moderator.
